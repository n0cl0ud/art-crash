## 🎯 What is Art Crash?

**Art Crash** is a minimalist puzzle-platformer that challenges you to think before you leap. With limited actions at your disposal, every jump, dash, teleport, and wall bounce must be calculated. It's not about reflexes—it's about **strategy**.

### 🧠 Core Concept: **Action Economy**
- Start each level with limited moves
- Collect "vibes" to gain new abilities  
- Navigate through fire 🔥, electricity ⚡, and ice ❄️ using specific techniques
- Master 10 hand-crafted levels of increasing complexity
